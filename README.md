# DishEat

## About the Project
DishEat is an innovative solution utilizing Flask, HTML, MySQL, and the OpenAI API to create personalized meal plans and recipes. Users input their dietary preferences and allergies, and the system offers tailored weekly menus, generates recipes based on photos of ingredients or dishes, and provides the option to send an email with an order list for the ingredients of the selected recipe.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your system, you will need the following tools installed:
- Python 3
- Flask
- MySQL
- Access to the OpenAI API

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/BOGI5/4ta-papka

2. Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

## How It Works
After answering questions about your dietary preferences and allergies, the system uses the OpenAI API to analyze the input data and create personalized meal plans and recipes tailored to your needs. MySQL is used for storing user information and recipes, while the email functionality makes it easier to shop for the necessary ingredients.
